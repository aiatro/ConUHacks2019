# Canadian üçÅ Heratige - Themed Challenge
## Challenge Objective
Create a web or mobile app to help Anglophone Quebecers navigate the majoritarily Francophone province of Quebec.

# Team Members
- Erdem Kepenek
- Anthony Iatropoulos
- Eglen √áe√ßaj

# Project Goal
Create an online portal to match people who need assistance with everyday tasks in French with someone who's fluent in the language. They communicate using a text based web-chat client (not fully implemented in the current release). The person who needs help in French could also ask the fluent speaker for tips on the language as a real human is more accurate than a bot like Google Translate.
